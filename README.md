## Information ?

Go to [Fluorite Website](https://fluorite.surge.sh) for more informations. I talk about configuration, installation, ect...

You can also find some quick tips inside CONFIG.md.

## Installation (basic informations)

### Deps

On Archlinux you can type this command to install everything you need.

``` sh
sudo pacman -S xorg
```

### Build and install

After doing modifications to the config, just type (WITHOUT sudo). It will remake and copy the Fluorite executable to `/usr/bin/`.

``` sh
make install
```

### .xinitrc example

``` sh
polybar &
picom &
setxkbmap -layout fr
exec Fluorite
```

Keep in mind that the setxkbmap with the proper keyboard layout is *REQUIRED* so you can have all your bindings working.

### Known issues

    - Java apps might be broken on some features. (ex: Ghidra)
    - Support for floating windows is a really early stage and might be unstable, use with caution.
